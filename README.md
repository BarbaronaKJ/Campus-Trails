## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Expo CLI** (we'll install this in the setup steps)
- **Expo Go app** on your mobile device (for testing on real device)
  - [Android - Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
  - [iOS - App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide for Beginners

#### Step 1: Install Git (if not already installed)

1. Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Use default settings unless you know what you're doing
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   You should see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.40.0`)

#### Step 2: Install Node.js (if not already installed)

1. Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both

#### Step 3: Pull the Project from Git

**Option A: Clone the Repository (First Time Setup)**

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., `cd Documents` or `cd Desktop`)
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual Git repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/Campus-Trails.git`)
4. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Campus-Trails
   ```

**Option B: Pull Latest Changes (If Project Already Exists)**

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/Campus-Trails
   ```
3. Pull the latest changes from Git:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   (Note: Replace `main` with `master` if your repository uses `master` as the default branch)

#### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

1. Make sure you're in the project folder (`Campus-Trails`)
2. Install all required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This may take a few minutes. Wait for it to complete.

#### Step 5: Install Expo CLI Globally

1. Install Expo CLI on your computer:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
   (You may need administrator/sudo privileges for this)

#### Step 6: Start the Development Server

1. Make sure you're still in the `Campus-Trails` folder
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

3. You should see:
   - A QR code in your terminal
   - Options to press keys for different platforms
   - A web interface (usually opens automatically at `http://localhost:19002`)

#### Step 7: Run the App on Your Device

**Option A: Using Expo Go App (Recommended for Beginners)**

1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone:
   - Android: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network

3. Scan the QR code:
   - **Android**: Open Expo Go app → Tap "Scan QR code" → Scan the QR code from terminal
   - **iOS**: Open Camera app → Point at QR code → Tap the notification that appears

4. The app should load on your device!

**Option B: Using an Emulator/Simulator**

- **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal (requires Android Studio setup)
- **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal (requires Xcode on macOS only)

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem: `git` command not found**
- Solution: Make sure Git is installed and added to your system PATH. Restart your terminal after installation.

**Problem: `npm` command not found**
- Solution: Make sure Node.js is installed. Restart your terminal after installation.

**Problem: `npm install` fails with errors**
- Solution: Try deleting `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```

**Problem: Expo Go can't connect to the development server**
- Solution: 
  - Make sure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
  - Try using tunnel mode: `expo start --tunnel`
  - Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

**Problem: Port already in use**
- Solution: Kill the process using the port or use a different port:
  ```bash
  expo start --port 8082
  ```

**Problem: Can't pull from Git (authentication required)**
- Solution: You may need to set up Git credentials:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
  For private repositories, you may need to set up SSH keys or use a personal access token.

### Daily Workflow

**Starting Work:**
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to project: `cd path/to/Campus-Trails`
3. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
4. Start development server: `npm start`
5. Scan QR code with Expo Go app

**Ending Work:**
1. Stop the development server (press `Ctrl+C` in terminal)
2. Commit and push your changes (if you made any):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 📦 Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `expo` - Expo framework
- `react` & `react-native` - React and React Native core
- `react-native-svg` - SVG rendering for map overlays
- `react-native-image-pan-zoom` - Map pan and zoom functionality
- `@expo/vector-icons` - Icon library (FontAwesome)

### Development Dependencies
- `@babel/core` - Babel transpiler
- `react-native-svg-transformer` - SVG file transformer

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Management
The application uses React hooks for state management:
- `useState` - Component state (modals, selections, filters)
- `useRef` - Animation values and references
- `useEffect` - Side effects and animations

### Component Organization
- **Main App Component** - Contains all UI and logic
- **Utility Functions** - Separated into `utils/` for reusability
- **Styles** - Centralized in `styles.js` for maintainability
- **Constants** - Application-wide constants in `constants/`

### Data Flow
1. Pin data loaded from `pinsData.js`
2. User interactions trigger state updates
3. Filters applied via `categoryFilter.js`
4. Pathfinding calculated via `pathfinding.js`
5. UI updates based on state changes

## 🎨 Styling

All styles are centralized in `styles.js` using React Native's `StyleSheet.create()`. This includes:
- Layout styles (containers, positioning)
- Component styles (buttons, modals, cards)
- Animation styles (transforms, opacity)
- Color schemes and themes

## 🔧 Configuration

### Expo Configuration (`app.json`)
- App name, version, and orientation
- Icon and splash screen settings
- Platform-specific configurations

### Metro Configuration (`metro.config.js`)
- Bundler settings for asset handling
- SVG transformer configuration

## 📝 Notes

- The map uses a high-resolution coordinate system (3387x3172)
- Pathfinding uses A* algorithm with bi-directional graph connections
- Category filtering supports multiple keyword matching
- All modals include smooth animations with spring physics
